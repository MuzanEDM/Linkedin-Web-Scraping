# Yale3
 Updated and simplified version of Rekrut (Linkedin scraper for extracting profile data)

Yale3 is a simplified version of [Rekrut](https://github.com/DrakenWan/Rekrut). Just enable developer mode in your `chrome://extensions` tab and click on `load unpacked` button and browse to the cloned folder. Run it on linkedin website profiles. Raw JSON profile data will be displayed on a sidebar that will appear when you click on the extension icon. Remember to scroll down slowly and click on all "show more" buttons if any to correctly extract data.


<b>Note </b> 

Extraction Code in [Rekrut](https://github.com/DrakenWan/Rekrut) chrome extension has become obsolete due to several policy changes on linkedin website such as content policy and certain CSS and DOM design changes.
However, the server sided script can still be implemented to this day.
