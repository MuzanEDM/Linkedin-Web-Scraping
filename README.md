# Yale3
 Updated and simplified version of Rekrut

Yale3 is a simplified version of [Rekrut](https://github.com/DrakenWan/Rekrut). Just enable developer mode in your `chrome://extensions` tab and click on `load unpacked` button and browse to the cloned folder. Run it on linkedin website profiles. Raw JSON profile data will be displayed on a sidebar that will appear when you click on the extension icon. Remember to scroll down slowly and click on all "show more" buttons if any to correctly extract data.
